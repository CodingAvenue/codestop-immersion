<p style="color:white;">CrossFire is an online tactical first-person shooter for Microsoft Windows developed by Smilegate Entertainment. The game was released in China by Tencent Games, with the company also acting as the exclusive agent service company. The tests for its software bugs were started publicly on April 2008.

Due to its popularity in Asia, especially China and South Korea, it became the most played game in the world by player count of all time, with 660 million players worldwide. It was the world's top-grossing online game as of 2014, and went on to become one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having grossed grossed $10.8 billion in lifetime revenue, as of 2018.

A film adaptation of the game was announced in October 2015. A remake and a sequel, CrossFire HD and CrossFire 2, respectively, are in development at Smilegate, with Remedy Entertainment working on both games' single-player portions.</p>
