		<p id = "firstparagraph" style = "background-color: #FFCBCB; border-style:solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: #FF4444; text-indent: 50px">Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg, popularly known as PewDiePie, became the most subscribed YouTube channel since 2012 and has managed to stay on the top until today. He has won various awards, and one of the greatest awards he received is the 50 million play button as an award for reaching 50 million subscribers. He also wrote and published a book entitled <b>"This Book Loves You"</b> where it is sold worldwide and became one of the bestsellers. He also had a show called <b>"Scare PewDiePie"</b> where he takes videogames in real life.</p>
		<p id = "secondparagraph" style = "background-color: #FFCBCB; border-style:solid; border-width: 3px; border-color: #FF4444; text-indent: 50px"> During his career, he faced many issues. The most controversial issue he faced was the <b>"Nazi Issue"</b> where he was accused by the media of being one of the Nazis. Because of the said issue, it made his reputation and image look bad to the public, but with the help of his supporters, he was able to correct the accusations being thrown to him. Fastforward, the current challenge he is facing is the war agains T-series, an Indian music company that will almost dethrone him as the most subscribed YouTube channel. In this war, many people had contributed in order to win. But it's not enough. He needs reinforcements. Every single person must do his/her part. I already did my part. DID YOU? You can do your part by subscribing to his YouTube channel. THANKS.</p>
