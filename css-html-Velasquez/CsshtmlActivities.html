		<p id="firstParagraph" style="text-align: left; color: #191970">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display the text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage. Because HTML is completely text-based, an HTML file can be edited simply by opening it up in a program such as Notepad++, Vi or Emacs. Any text editor can be used to create or edit an HTML file and, so long as the file is created with a .html extension, any web browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, will be capable of displaying the file as a webpage.</p>
		<p id="secondParagraph" style="text-align: left; color: #191970">This definition explains the meaning of CSS (cascading style sheets) and how using them with HTML pages is a user interface (UI) development best practice that complies with the separation of concerns design pattern. CSS information is referred to as an inline style. The fact that style rules dictate that parent-level styles are overridden by page-level styles and page-level styles are overridden by tag-level styles is what is meant by style sheets being cascading.</p>
